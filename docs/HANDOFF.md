# AI handoff — Kowloon re-charge PS2 English translation

## Mission

Create a high-quality English translation of the Japanese PS2 **Kowloon Youma Gakuenki re-charge** by backporting the official PS4 remaster English wherever correspondence is provable, then translate PS2/re-charge-exclusive material separately. Pablo supervises; the agent performs reverse engineering, tooling, builds, validation, documentation and Git work.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Never alter pristine PS2/PS4 sources; derive outputs from copies/pristine inputs.
2. Never commit copyrighted game binaries, extracted assets, official bulk localization data, fonts, textures, ISO/PKG/CVM files or executable fixtures.
3. Automatic import is fail-closed. Ambiguous correspondence remains Japanese and is reported; never guess merely to increase coverage.
4. Preserve `SLPM-66511` and `BISLPM-66511Save` across builds.
5. **Do not launch PCSX2 until the exact expected visible result for that build has been stated to Pablo and Pablo explicitly approves the launch.** Static analysis/builds need no approval.
6. Pablo authorized autonomous implementation/documentation/Git decisions. Do not stop for routine approvals.

## Runtime history

### v1 broad candidate — failed

The first broad candidate updated ISO9660 but not the executable's internal ROFS file table. Runtime therefore loaded old Japanese extents. The title patch also wrote single-byte ASCII into a two-byte glyph renderer, producing roughly 4–5 meaningless glyphs.

Proven fixes:

- `SLPM_665.11` ROFS records store size at `filename-14` and sector extent at `filename-6`; generic builds patch and revalidate them atomically with ISO9660.
- title text uses the PS2 two-byte glyph path.

### v2 runtime — useful but failed the clarified startup acceptance scope

The ROFS/title fixes were brought to runtime. Before the first dialogue Pablo observed Japanese startup screens: a Solomon quotation, Japanese name-entry prompts/keyboard/buttons, and a title where the constrained `NewGame` label was visibly clipped. Pablo then clarified that the **first acceptance test must cover everything from the beginning of the game through the first old-man dialogue**.

Do not treat v2 as accepted.

## v5 runtime — renderer-class discovery, failed acceptance

v5 was launched and is **not accepted**. Runtime established these class-level facts:

- all 29 opening quote textures rendered correctly in English;
- `New Game` / `Load Game` rendered correctly;
- B_GP019 name-entry control graphics rendered correctly;
- the Latin name keyboard rendered correctly;
- name/profile prompts and default names were garbage because v5 wrote single-byte ASCII into another two-byte-glyph renderer;
- ADV dialogue English glyphs were present but laid out vertically because the Japanese renderer maps script line/byte-position fields to vertical columns;
- the H.A.N.T. tutorial remained Japanese and is a separate executable pointer-table text class.

These are now modeled as reusable automator classes rather than screenshot-specific fixes.

## Current candidate — startup v6, statically verified, NOT launched

Candidate:

- path: `/private/tmp/kowloon-recharge-startup-en-v6.iso`
- SHA-256: `beaaa53bbfe3a60cd3af6749d4113cd4d91e81d804b122f80b85c347bded761b`
- 1,143 overlay assets
- 890 in place / 253 relocated
- +900 embedded sectors
- 17 shifted outer files
- 1,143/1,143 executable ROFS records patched/re-resolved
- finished ISO size unchanged at 2,095,382,528 bytes
- final ELF size: 8,401,977 bytes; it still fits the original outer ISO sector allocation
- final post-ROFS ELF SHA-256: `2dacea600e06c4db29311402ae5a1ae0880be23bfab2cfb3e8b0e1a811831922`
- reproducible final-image startup acceptance: **96/96 checks passed** (`local/startup-acceptance-v6.json`)
- Pillow-enabled suite: **121/121 tests pass**
- **PCSX2 has not been launched for v6. Fresh explicit approval is required.**

## Startup renderer/storage classes

### Opening quotations

The pre-title quote is not runtime CP932 text. The title module selects a random index modulo 29 and loads:

`BLBRD/INIT_MES/TR%03d.TMX`

There are exactly `TR000.TMX`–`TR028.TMX`; PS2 files are 512×512 standalone 8-bit indexed TMX and 263,232 bytes each. Official PS4 English equivalents are 1152×1152 Texture2D objects in bundle `BLBRD/tr_en`.

All 29 official English images are now downscaled/quantized/repacked into same-size PS2 TMX outputs under ignored `local/startup-graphics/BLBRD/INIT_MES/`.

Evidence (`local/startup-quotes-report.json`):

- 29/29 generated;
- every file retains pristine byte size;
- maximum mean absolute RGBA error versus the downscaled official image: **0.5594 / 255**;
- every final candidate quote file hashes to its overlay and has a valid final ROFS record.

### Title

The exact official labels are now `New Game` and `Load Game`, not the clipped `NewGame` workaround. A verified 40-byte source arena at `0x5CBDE8..0x5CBE10` holds both two-byte strings; `Load Game` is moved to `0x5CBDFC` and its pointer at `0x5CBE54` is updated. The third title pointer/blank string remains untouched.

### Name/profile flow

The v5 runtime proved that these prompts/names are also a two-byte-glyph renderer. v6 therefore packs official English as wide CP932 into verified module-local arenas and repoints the existing prompt/name tables rather than writing ASCII into the original slots. The class covers `Enter last name.`, `Enter first name.`, confirmation/license messages, `Heracleion Shrine`, and protagonist/default names (`Habaki`, `Kuro`, `Hiyuu`, `Tatsuma`). Reading prompts/readings are suppressed like the official English remaster.

The name keyboard is 14 fixed rows. Runtime copies exactly two bytes per selected cell, so the English keyboard preserves wide/two-byte glyphs and the original 20-key logical geometry. It now provides Latin lower/uppercase letters, digits and punctuation instead of kana.

### Name-entry button graphics

The visible Japanese control captions are baked into `BLBRD/B_GP019.BIN`, especially `GRP019/GP019_01.TMX`. The official PS4 English bundle is `BLBRD/b_gp019_en`. Both relevant official PNGs are ported into a same-size PS2 container:

- local output: `local/startup-graphics/BLBRD/B_GP019.BIN`
- output size: 264,640 (unchanged)
- output SHA-256: `529aa604ba3d1e987d062daceb3e8045566d47e43b81665f8d7fa9b831b01227`

### ADV dialogue layout

`DG/DG00_00.MTX` remains the opening dialogue proof. v5 showed that the localized two-byte English itself was present, but the Japanese ADV renderer displayed it vertically. Static code/data tracing proved the script compiler stores line index in record field `+0x463` and byte position in `+0x465`, while the renderer used `+0x463` as X and `+0x465/2` as Y. v6 performs a fail-closed four-instruction renderer transform so X uses `+0x465/2` and Y uses `+0x463`. This is a renderer-class patch and therefore applies to ADV dialogue generally, not only DG00.

### Executable long-text / H.A.N.T class

The H.A.N.T. tutorial is an executable pointer table at `0x5C8C70`; its visible strings do not safely fit their Japanese slots. The pristine ELF has a zero-sized second PT_LOAD at virtual address `0x00902F00`. v6 uses it as a reusable translation text segment, reserves a 1 MiB virtual window by moving only the heap start, packs the wide official English there, and repoints the H.A.N.T. table. This mechanism is intended for other executable-resident long strings as they are classified.

## Current corpus/import coverage

MTX:

- PS2: 1,516
- PS4 counterparts: 1,067
- PS2-only: 449
- byte-identical common: 1,022
- exact + English-mapped: 985 / 78,314 official entries
- proven exact import: **962 files / 56,642 entries**
- rejected exact: 23 files / 21,672 entries
- changed + English-mapped: 43 / 22,084 entries
- proven changed/template import: **7 files / 2,284 entries**

Seven structural/template outputs: `DG13_02`, `FD00_31`, `FN13_16`, `ID00_21`, `ID00_26`, `ID00_41`, `MS05_03`.

KSF:

- exact common: **1,010** (do not revive old exploratory 1,019)
- exact + English-mapped: 144 files
- fitting official entries: 868
- overflow: 48
- ambiguous: 4

PS2-only lexical proxy:

- 41,337 unique Japanese lexical runs overall
- 568 occur in PS2-only MTX
- only **419 runs / 3,672 Japanese characters** are novel relative to mapped common content
- this is an estimator, not a dialogue-line percentage.

## Known unsolved areas

- 23 exact MTX maps use indirect/dynamic localization semantics and remain rejected.
- 25/26 consolidated FD00 template files fail the generic structural proof; only FD00_31 passes. A dedicated semantic/template interpreter is required.
- KSF overflow relocation is unproven; 48 official strings remain untouched unless a reviewed constrained override exists.
- Broad graphics backport beyond the startup slice is not done. The PS4 assets are located; PS2 TMX encoding/repacking is now proven for normal indexed startup cases, but special-layout assets need per-format proof.
- Cross-build memory-card save compatibility still needs a real runtime create/load test. Savestates are not compatibility targets.

## Exact runtime gate for v6

Before launching v6, state the exact expected visible sequence and wait for Pablo's explicit approval. The test covers **every text-bearing screen from startup through the first old-man dialogue**. Any Japanese text, garbage prompt/name, vertical dialogue, or untranslated H.A.N.T. tutorial in that slice is a failed acceptance checkpoint and should be captured for renderer/data-path analysis.

## After a successful v6 runtime test

1. Promote the reviewed startup renderer classes/graphics checkpoint into regression metadata as appropriate.
2. Back up the memory card and establish a golden in-game save; prove it loads in a later build.
3. Generalize the now-proven classes across the whole corpus, then continue dynamic exact maps, FD00 semantic templates, KSF overflow research and broad graphics.
4. Translate the small novel PS2-only remainder using official terminology/style.

## Resume procedure

1. `cd /Users/juan.pena/repos/kowloon-recharge-translation`
2. Read this file, `docs/BUILD.md`, `docs/DISCOVERY.md`, and `docs/REGRESSION.md`.
3. Run both test suites; graphics tests require optional Pillow.
4. Check `git status --short --branch` and recent commits.
5. Regenerate ignored `local/` evidence if implementation changed; never trust stale generated files.
6. Always build from the pristine PS2 ISO.
7. Never launch PCSX2 without the exact-visual-scope approval gate.
